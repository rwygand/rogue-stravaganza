# Unamed Game

Unamed Game is a game about destroying the GDP of a fictional nation-state in 
the throes of late-stage capitalism. It is a top-down, tile-based, 2D rogue-lite.
The adventurer will be given a set number of rounds to annihilate the economy by 
wandering the map and placing tiles, via cards. A round ends when the player is
captured by the corpo-fascist State and imprisoned.

## Characters

The player controls one character in the quest to eradicate GDP. The game is 
initially limited to a single class, though additional classes may be added 
Classes will have customized card sets and unique abilities.

The player may encounter helpful NPCs in their wanderings of the procedurally
generated State.

The player will also encounter the agents of oppressive order who will seek to
capture and imprison them.

## Story

The year is 2157. A global economic and political system run by authoritarian
corporations oppresses the masses. "Buy or die" is the law of the land. You,
with the help of a few comrades-in-arms, set out to destroy this system of
economic oppression and restore hope to humanity.

The game takes place in a near-future world.   

## Progression

## Gameplay

The goal of the game is to lower the State GDP to zero.

The player is given a fixed number of "rounds" in which to navigate the map and 
and interact with the map, while evading or defeating State Actors. Being captured
results in a new "round" beginning.

There are NPCs and events scattered around the map. The player can interact with
these via their cards, and in some cases directly. For example, if a player 
encounters a "Brand Launch" event, they could place a pipe bomb card. At the end
of each round, each card played/encounter/npc interaction will have some net
effect on the State GDP.

## Goals
* Reduce the State GDP to zero
* per round:
  * play as many cards as possible to maximized effect
  * interact with as many events and npcs without being captured
  * discover powerups which alter gameplay in subsequent levels
  
## Player Skills
* tactical gameplay of cards to maximize effect
* long and short term resource management?

## Losing
The game ends after a fixed number of rounds. If the State GDP is more than 0, 
the player has lost. A score board of the lowest scores will be maintained. 

## Technical Description
The game will be written in Rust, using Bevy as the game engine. It will support
PC, Mac and Linux, with WebASsembly for browser-based play being a stretch goal.
